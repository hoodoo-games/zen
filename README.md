## About

**Every game is unique.** Engine design is inherently a trade-off between batteries-included functionality and adaptability. Sometimes it's better to build a solution that works well for you, rather than wrangle a solution designed by somebody else. Zen provides a simple yet powerful foundation without making assumptions about the games that will build upon it.

**The web is the future.** The web is the closest thing we have to a universal platform. Web-based distribution and portability are unmatched and free from the walled gardens that dominate native software today. Modern web tech like WebAssembly and WebGPU greatly expand the capabilites of the platform and will enable a new age of high-performance interactive software.

Development should be fun, not frustrating.

**Extensions.** //TODO explain extension architecture.
